Q: Why scripts are written as:
   ---[SNIP ]---
   <script type="text/javascript" src="...">
   <![CDATA[ <!-- // -->]]>
   </script>
   ---[/SNIP]---
   instead of:
   ---[SNIP ]---
   <script type="text/javascript" src="..."/>
   ---[/SNIP]---
   ?
A: It seems some browser (e.g. Firefox 2.0.11) uncorrectly interprets the last
   version rendering the page very bad.

Q: Why my application server bother about JDBC driver class not found?
A: Installing this jar in your WEB-INF/lib path it doesn't work since some
   application server (e.g. Apache Tomcat) expects that DataSources will be
   installed in its lib directory (e.g. for Tomcat: $CATALINE_HOME/lib).
   Using tomcat's JNDI resources, the driver has to be in $CATALINE_HOME/lib.
   If the application defines and manages it's own pool separate from Tomcat,
   then you could put it in the app's WEB-INF/lib folder. This has everything to
   do with how the classloaders work. Since Tomcat and your webapp both have to
   have access to the driver when using container managed connection pools, it
   has to be in $CATALINE_HOME/lib.

Q: Why session is re-initialized ad each step?
A: It's seem there are problems if you don't use JSF v.1.2b03. For instance,
   using JSF 1.2b07 session is initilized at each step.
   Using a greater version of JSF, like JSF 1.2_10, the problem should be
   solved.
