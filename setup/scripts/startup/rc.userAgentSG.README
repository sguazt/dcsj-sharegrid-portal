-- PURPOSE ---------------------------------------------------------------------

This shell script allow you to start the 'userAgentSG' application at machine
boot time.

-- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

* Linux operating system.
* 'root' user privileges.
* The 'userAgentSG' program already installed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- QUICK INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ---------------------------------------------

1. Change the name of the user used for running the 'userAgentSG' program. 
   [Default: user=sharegrid]
   If the default value is not for you, you need to change the '$user' variable
   inside the 'rc.userAgentSG' script.

2. Change the path to the 'userAgentSG' program.
   [Default: useragent="/home/$user/shareGrid/userAgentSG/useragent"]
   If the default value is not for you, you need to change the '$useragent'
   variable inside the 'rc.userAgentSG' script.

3. Gain 'root' privileges.
   Log-in as 'root' user or, alternatively, use the 'sudo' command.

4. Add the script in the 'start-up script' directory of your operating system.
   This location is operating-system dependent. In many Linux operating systems
   it is typically named '/etc/init.d'. If this is your case, simply run:
     $ cp rc.userAgentSG /etc/init.d/.
   Otherwise, refer to your operating system administration guide.

5. Change the script attributes.
   In order to execute the script, you need to add the execution attribute:
     $ chmod u+x /etc/init.d/rc.userAgentSG

6. Tell your operating system to run the script at boot time.
   If you run a RedHat-like operating system, you can simply run the following
   command:
     $ chkconfig --add rc.userAgentSG
   If not, please consult your operating system administration guide.

7. Test your installation by running (with 'root' privileges):
     $ /etc/init.d/rc.userAgentSG start
   If the output shows the message 'OK', the installation is done. Otherwise,
   try to repeat the installation steps (maybe using the instructions of the
   next section).

-- LONG INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ----------------------------------------------

In order to use the 'userAgentSG' start-up script, you need to follow some
basic installation steps:

1. Open the 'rc.userAgentSG' file with your preferred text editor.

2. Change the name of the user used for running the 'userAgentSG' program. 
   As default, the script assumes you run the 'userAgentSG' application under
   the user 'sharegrid', that is:
     ---[ snip]---
     user=sharegrid
     ---[/snip]---
   For changing the default behavior, you need to change the variable '$user'.
   For instance, for changing the user to 'myuser', just comment the line shown
   above and add a new one where the '$user' get assigned the 'myuser' value.
   After this, your script fragment should look like the following:
     ---[ snip]---
     #user=sharegrid
     user=myuser
     ---[/snip]---

3. Change the path to the 'userAgentSG' program.
   As default, the script assumes the 'userAgentSG' program is placed under the
   'shareGrid' directory of the '$user' home directory, that is:
     ---[ snip]---
     useragent="/home/$user/shareGrid/userAgentSG/useragent"
     ---[/snip]---
   where '$user' is the variable whose meaning has been explained in the
   previous step (step #2).
   For changing the default behavior, you need to change the variable
   '$useragent'.
   For instance, if the 'userAgentSG' program is placed under the
   '/opt/shareGrid/ua' folder, just comment the line shown above and add a new
   one where the '$useragent' get assigned the new value.
   After this, your script fragment should look like the following:
     ---[ snip]---
     #useragent="/home/$user/shareGrid/userAgentSG/useragent"
     useragent="/opt/shareGrid/ua/useragent"
     ---[/snip]---

4. Change the log file path.
   Log file is used for tracing the start-up program execution.
   As default, the script logs messages in the '/var/log/rc.userAgentSG' file.
   If you don't like it, you can simply change the variable '$logfile'.
   For instance, for logging to the '/var/opt/log/rc.userAgentSG' file, just
   comment the line containing the old value and add a new line with the new
   value:
     ---[ snip]---
     #logfile=${LOGFILE-/var/log/$subsys}
     logfile=/var/opt/log/$subsys}
     ---[/snip]---
   If you don't want to produce any log file, you can simply log to the
   '/dev/null' special file:
     ---[ snip]---
     #logfile=${LOGFILE-/var/log/$subsys}
     logfile=/dev/null
     ---[/snip]---

5. Change the lock file path.
   Lock file is used for avoiding to start two instances of the same program.
   As default, the script creates the '/var/lock/subsys/rc.userAgentSG' lock
   file.
   If you don't like it, you can simply change the variable '$lockfile'.
   For instance, for changing it to the '/var/opt/lock/rc.userAgentSG' file,
   just comment the line containing the old value and add a new line with the
   new value:
     ---[ snip]---
     #lockfile=${LOCKFILE-/var/lock/subsys/$subsys}
     lockfile=/var/opt/lock/rc.userAgentSG
     ---[/snip]---

6. Save changes and exit from the text-editor.

7. Gain 'root' privileges.
   Log-in as 'root' user or, alternatively, use the 'sudo' command.

8. Add the script in the 'start-up script' directory of your operating system.
   This location is operating-system dependent. In many Linux operating systems
   it is typically named '/etc/init.d'. If this is your case, simply run:
     $ cp rc.userAgentSG /etc/init.d/.
   Otherwise, refer to your operating system administration guide.

9. Tell your operating system to run the script at boot time.
   If you run a RedHat-like operating system, you can simply run the following
   command:
     $ chkconfig --add rc.userAgentSG
   and then check the installation running:
     $ chkconfig --list rc.userAgentSG
   The output of this last command should look like the following:
     ---[ snip]---
     rc.userAgentSG  0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
     ---[/snip]---
   If your operating system is not a RedHat-like one, please consult your
   operating system administration guide.

10. For testing if the installation is OK, you can simply reboot the machine or
   manually run the following command (with 'root' privileges):
     $ /etc/init.d/rc.userAgentSG start
   If the output shows the message 'OK', the installation is done. Otherwise,
   try to repeat the installation steps.
